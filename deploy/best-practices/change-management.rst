---

Server configuration changes should be done through change management. Accurate records of the time of change and reason for change can enable faster issue diagnosis.

Automation can enable repeatability of change deployment, and can aid Pre-Production and Post-Production testing.

Automation or orchestration can enable repeatability of server deployment, including system provisioning.
