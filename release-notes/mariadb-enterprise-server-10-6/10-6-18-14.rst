<%PROD_VER_DATE%>

<%CVE_LIST%>

## Notable Changes
---

* Galera has been updated to ``26.4.18``

  * The GCS protocol version has been changed, preventing a downgrade of individual nodes of a MariaDB Enterprise Cluster

* Changes to the use of the variable ``optimizer_adjust_secondary_index_costs`` «ext-issue»«MDEV-33306»

  * The default of the variable ``optimizer_adjust_secondary_index_costs`` changed from ``"0"`` to ``""`` and is now of type ``ENUM``

  * The variable can now be set to a combination of the following values separated by a ``','``:

    * ``adjust_secondary_key_cost``: Update secondary key costs for ranges to be at least 5x of clustered primary key costs.

    * ``disable_max_seek``: Disable 'max_seek optimization' for secondary keys and slight adjustment of filter cost.

    * ``disable_forced_index_in_group_by``: Disable automatic forced index in ``GROUP BY`` and make ``GROUP BY`` cost based instead of rule based. ALL Sets all of the above values.

  * Without changes in configuration or using the old integer values ``0``, ``1``, ``2`` for ``optimizer_adjust_secondary_key_costs`` this system variable works as before. This is to ensure that we do not break any existing applications.

## Changes in Storage Engines
---

* This release originally incorporated MariaDB ColumnStore engine version 23.10.1.

* This release now incorporates MariaDB ColumnStore engine version 23.10.2.

## Issues Fixed
---

### Can result in data loss
---

* InnoDB may hang when temporarily running out of buffer pool «ext-issue»«MDEV-33613»

* For encrypted table spaces an ``ALTER`` operation can hang when an encryption thread works on the same tablespace «ext-issue»«MDEV-33770»

* ``EXPLAIN`` statement that uses a subquery which has a query plan that A) will examine less than ``@@expensive_subquery_limit`` rows and B) will use join buffer could cause a crash. «ext-issue»«MDEV-21102»

* For a SPIDER table, when deleting partitions from a table, the server can crash «ext-issue»«MDEV-33731»

* MDL lock conflict can occur if the transactions acquire explicit MDL locks from the InnoDB level when persistent statistics is re-read for a table and such a transaction is subject to BF-abort «ext-issue»«MDEV-33136»

* Graceful node shutdown can crash garbd and MariaDB Enterprise Cluster can go non-primary when SSL is used «ext-issue»«MDEV-33495»

### Can result in unexpected behavior
---

* Wrong result sets are returned by the second execution of prepared statements from selects using mergeable derived tables pushed into external engine «ext-issue»«MDEV-31361»

* ``IMPORT TABLESPACE`` fails with column count or index count mismatch: «ext-issue»«MDEV-30655»

* When creating a temporary InnoDB table with ``CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ... AS SELECT ...`` from an InnoDB table as a non SUPER / READ ONLY ADMIN user, the following error is shown instead of creating the table: «ext-issue»«MDEV-33889»

  .. code-block::

    ERROR 1290 (HY000): The MariaDB server is running with the --read-only option so it cannot execute this statement

  * ``CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE (without SELECT)``, ``INSERT ... SELECT``, and ``CREATE ... LIKE`` are not affected by this bug

* Phantom rows caused by ``UPDATE`` of ``PRIMARY KEY`` «ext-issue»«MDEV-32898»

* Mariadb-dump trusts the server and does not validate the data. A modified dump file can include system commands used by the mariadb-client. Dumps are now loaded in the sandbox mode by default, a system call will result in an error «ext-issue»«MDEV-33727»

* Updating a case insensitive large unique key with an insensitive change of the value can result in a duplicate key error «ext-issue»«MDEV-29345»

* When setting ``binlog_annotate_row_events=1``, an event of binlog file can be truncated «ext-issue»«MDEV-9179»

* Wrong result with semi-join and split-table derived table from queries with an ``IN`` subquery predicate in the ``WHERE`` clause and a derived table in the ``FROM`` clause to which split materialized optimization could be applied. «ext-issue»«MDEV-23878»

* With galera, correct transactions could not be committed with the following error when accessing system tables for read, and write to innodb tables in the same transaction: «ext-issue»«MDEV-33828»

  .. code-block::

    Transactional commit not supported by involved engine

* A wrong result on 2-nd execution of a prepared statement is possible when selecting from a view using a merged derived table «ext-issue»«MDEV-31277»

* Original IP not shown in network related error messages when proxy_protocol is in use «ext-issue»«MDEV-33506»

* Incorrect ``DEFAULT`` expression evaluated in UPDATE «ext-issue»«MDEV-33790»

* group by optimization incorrectly removing subquery where subject buried in a function «ext-issue»«MDEV-28621»

### Related to performance
---

* Replication with XA events can show decreased performance. Adapt parallel slave's round-robin scheduling to XA events «ext-issue»«MDEV-33668»

* Row locks for non-modified rows are not released at ``XA PREPARE`` «ext-issue»«MDEV-33454»

* Optimizer is sometimes choosing an index for queries with ``GROUP BY`` when it shouldn't, resulting in decreased performance. To protect compatibility to the current behavior ``@@optimizer_adjust_secondary_key_costs="disable_forced_index_in_group_by"`` has to be set to enable the fix «ext-issue»«MDEV-33306»

* Table is getting rebuild with ``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`` although it should be an instant operation not requiring a rebuild «ext-issue»«MDEV-33214»

* Semi-sync Wait Point ``AFTER_COMMIT`` Slow on Workloads with Heavy Concurrency «ext-issue»«MDEV-33551»

* Aggregation functions fail to leverage uniqueness property «ext-issue»«MDEV-30660»

  * Generally, computing aggregate function with DISTINCT argument: ``aggregate_func(DISTINCT col1, col2, ...)`` requires producing a de-duplicated set of its arguments, which can be CPU-intensive

  * When we select from one table the argument list includes the table's PRIMARY (or UNIQUE) key:

    .. code-block::

      SELECT aggregate_func(DISTINCT t1.primary_key, ...) FROM t1;

    then the arguments are guaranteed not to have duplicates. Such cases are now detected allowing the optimizer to skip de-duplication.
